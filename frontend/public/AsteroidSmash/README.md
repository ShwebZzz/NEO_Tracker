Retro Space Defense

Drop optional PNG assets into an `assets/` folder at the project root to override code-drawn visuals.

Supported filenames (place in c:\asteroid game\assets\):
- ship.png    — drawn centered on the ship (pixel art recommended)
- asteroid.png — drawn centered and scaled to asteroid radius
- heart.png   — drawn at HUD positions (7x7 recommended)
- earth.png   — drawn stretched across bottom (recommend wide rectangular image)

All assets are optional; if missing the game uses built-in pixel rendering.

Open `index.html` in a browser to run the game.
