# 🎯 Dynamic Hover Text Feature - Impact Page

## ✨ Feature Overview

Added interactive hover text that changes the description based on which button you hover over on the Impact Page!

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Default State (No Hover):
```
Explore the devastating effects of meteoroid impacts on Earth.
Analyze real NASA asteroid data and predict impact scenarios.
Learn about detection, prediction, and planetary defense strategies.
```

### When Hovering "CUSTOM SIMULATOR" Button:
```
Design your own asteroid scenarios with custom parameters.
Control size, velocity, composition, and impact angle.
Simulate devastating impacts and analyze the consequences.
```

### When Hovering "NASA NEO ANALYSIS" Button:
```
Explore the devastating effects of meteoroid impacts on Earth.
Analyze real NASA asteroid data and predict impact scenarios.
Learn about detection, prediction, and planetary defense strategies.
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### JavaScript Changes (ImpactPage.js):

1. **State Management**:
   ```javascript
   const [hoveredButton, setHoveredButton] = useState(null);
   ```

2. **Button Text Content**:
   ```javascript
   const buttonTexts = {
     custom: {
       line1: "Design your own asteroid scenarios with custom parameters.",
       line2: "Control size, velocity, composition, and impact angle.",
       line3: "Simulate devastating impacts and analyze the consequences."
     },
     real: {
       line1: "Explore the devastating effects of meteoroid impacts on Earth.",
       line2: "Analyze real NASA asteroid data and predict impact scenarios.",
       line3: "Learn about detection, prediction, and planetary defense strategies."
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Dynamic Description**:
   - Uses conditional rendering based on `hoveredButton` state
   - Smoothly transitions between different text content

4. **Button Hover Events**:
   ```javascript
   onMouseEnter={() => setHoveredButton('custom')}
   onMouseLeave={() => setHoveredButton(null)}
   ```

### CSS Changes (ImpactPage.css):

1. **Smooth Transitions**:
   ```css
   .impact-main-description {
     transition: all 0.3s ease;
     min-height: 75px; /* Prevents layout shift */
   }
   ```

## 🎨 Text Content Breakdown

### CUSTOM SIMULATOR (Custom Asteroid):
| Line | Text |
|------|------|
| 1 | "Design your own asteroid scenarios with custom parameters." |
| 2 | "Control size, velocity, composition, and impact angle." |
| 3 | "Simulate devastating impacts and analyze the consequences." |

**Focus**: User control, customization, simulation

### NASA NEO ANALYSIS (Real Asteroid):
| Line | Text |
|------|------|
| 1 | "Explore the devastating effects of meteoroid impacts on Earth." |
| 2 | "Analyze real NASA asteroid data and predict impact scenarios." |
| 3 | "Learn about detection, prediction, and planetary defense strategies." |

**Focus**: Real data, analysis, defense strategies

## 🚀 User Experience

### Visual Feedback:
- ✅ Text changes instantly on hover
- ✅ Smooth 0.3s transition effect
- ✅ No layout shift (fixed min-height)
- ✅ Maintains page stability

### Interaction Flow:
1. User lands on Impact page → sees default text
2. User hovers over "CUSTOM SIMULATOR" → sees custom asteroid text
3. User hovers over "NASA NEO ANALYSIS" → sees real asteroid text
4. User moves mouse away → returns to default text

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hover over CUSTOM SIMULATOR button
- [ ] Verify text changes to custom asteroid description
- [ ] Hover over NASA NEO ANALYSIS button
- [ ] Verify text changes to real asteroid description
- [ ] Move mouse away
- [ ] Verify text returns to default
- [ ] Check smooth transitions
- [ ] Verify no layout jumps or shifts
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test on mobile (touch devices)

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

On touch devices (mobile/tablet):
- No hover state (as expected)
- Default text always shows
- Users can still click buttons to navigate
- Consider adding touch-based alternative if needed

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

Want to change the text? Edit the `buttonTexts` object in ImpactPage.js:

```javascript
const buttonTexts = {
  custom: {
    line1: "Your custom line 1",
    line2: "Your custom line 2",
    line3: "Your custom line 3"
  },
  real: {
    line1: "Your real asteroid line 1",
    line2: "Your real asteroid line 2",
    line3: "Your real asteroid line 3"
  }
};
```
